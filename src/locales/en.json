      "A modeller... I've been making models my entire life. I made my first model when I was 6 or 7 - most of us started this way, I think. Years passed, the shelves filled up, I directed my model work. Nowadays, it's mainly World War 2 era fighters with a particular emphasis on Supermarine Spitfire.",
      "A while back, I started making resin casts and then I picked up decal design. I drew for Model Maker, Brengun, Karay, and several other firms. For a couple years I've been trying to help my model making comerades in finding those \"once in a lifetime\" markings for their models. The finalization of that was the creation of Mr. Decal - that nickname was given to me by my friend-model builder, Artur. So, welcome!"
